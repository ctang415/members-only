This was my first official NodeJS project using passport and dotenv to create a message board that has user authentication and CRUD functionalities. Because this was my third project utilizing mongoose and express, I started to get the hang of creating routes to forward requests and controller functions to retrieve the request data, and I also feel a lot more familiarized with the mongoose object data model. While managing user data is a daunting task due to security and privacy reasons, I definitely gained confidence in building a secure back-end thanks to the MDN tutorial. I learned how to use environment variables to protect my MongoDB credentials and my secret password which I used to approve memberships. 

Funny enough, I think the most difficult part of this project for me was making sure the middleware functions were arranged in the right order and place. I had so many issues with passport that were resolved simply by moving the code around in the app file. If there's one thing I learned from this project, it's that I definitely should go over each piece of middleware and understand why it needs to be initialized in the particular order that it's being set in. I spent a lot of time mulling over what was wrong with my code when the problem was really the fact that I didn't initialize the functions in the right place.
